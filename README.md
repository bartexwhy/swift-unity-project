# The game - Swift
Small personal indie game with squares that apparently doesn't know when to stop. Originally I started working on this game in April 2021 but the amount of sprawling ideas comming into my head overwhelmed me. But I'm eager to complete it, or at least try to finish it starting from these year.
<br> It's a game created by me (pulo0)

# About Swift
Tiny indie game made with Unity. You control via physics-based controls square, simple square and then you shoot other squares. Sounds simple? Well because it is simple. So if this game is too basic for you, let's sprinkle some different enemy variety or multiple weapons with each of them doing different things. Multiple choices to kill multiple varieties of squares. That's kinda fun, right?
